lady coder in training
I grew up in Silicon Valley, but outside the tech world. I have been a litigation paralegal for 11 years. I have had a series of crappy blogs that I have coded on my own at a very basic level. I recently left California and moved to a Midwestern city with a nascent tech market and I'm ready to make a career change. Yes, I realize it is kind of ridiculous that I am only getting into tech after leaving Silicon Valley.
